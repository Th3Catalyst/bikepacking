Dawn Rae & Rob Knoth (my parents) for their many routes on ridewithgps.com from which my images and some text came from: https://ridewithgps.com/ambassadors/488-dawn-rae-rob-knoth

Side bar:
  https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:toggle-sidebar (keep in mind that this code does not work completely in this software, and had to be changed, as this is meant to run in another software that I use. (Wikidot))
