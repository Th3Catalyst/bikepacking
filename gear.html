    <h3>Different Setups</h3>
    <p class="geartop">
        The beauty of bikepacking is that it is so open-ended, and there is no one "correct" way to go bikepacking. With that said, there are some basic setups that are always reliable.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Just a Normal Bike</h3>
    <p>
        It's a good idea to start with the bike that you already have for your first bikepacking trip. Since bikepacking has such a variety of routes, you can easily find one that you can do with minimal specialized gear, and on any bike.
    </p>
    <h4>Key Gear for This Setup</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Dry Bag: You can use any old dry bag you have lying around the house for this. With your dry bag, strap the bag to your seatpost (for smaller bags), or to the front of your bike's handlebars (for larger bags) using <a href="https://www.voilestraps.com/" target="_blank">voile straps</a>.</li>
        <li>Backpack: For many types of bikepacking, it’s more comfortable to ride without a backpack, but they can be useful for more technical rides (especially those that require their fair share of hike-a-biking), or for carrying a camera, or if you don’t yet have bikepacking bags. You can use any old day pack for this, and this is most useful for carrying some extra water, food, or sleeping supplies.</li>
        <li>Electrical tape bottle cages: In addition to your standard water bottle cage mounts, use about one third to a half roll of electrical tape to add bottle cages to your fork legs or the underside of your down tube. This is a better place to store water than in a backpack. You can also attach tire tubes to your bike using electrical tape.</li>
    </ul>
