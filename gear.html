    <h2>Different Setups</h2>
    <p>
      The beauty of bikepacking is that it is so open-ended, and there is no one "correct" way to go bikepacking. With that said, there are some basic setups that are always reliable.

    <h3>Just a Normal Bike</h3>
    <p>
      It's a good idea to start with the bike that you already have for your first bikepacking trip. Since bikepacking has such a variety of routes, you can easily find one that you can do with minimal specialized gear, and on any bike.
    </p>
    <h4>Key Gear for This Setup</h4>
    <!-- list element (ul does not have numbers) -->
    <ul>
      <li>Dry Bag: You can use any old dry bag you have lying around the house for this. With your dry bag, strap the bag to your seatpost (for smaller bags), or to the front of your bike's handlebars (for larger bags) using <a href="https://www.voilestraps.com/" target="_blank">voile straps</a>.</li>
      <li>Backpack: For many types of bikepacking, it’s more comfortable to ride without a backpack, but they can be useful for more technical rides (especially those that require their fair share of hike-a-biking), or for carrying a camera, or if you don’t yet have bikepacking bags. You can use any old day pack for this, and this is most useful for carrying some extra water, food, or sleeping supplies.</li>
      <li>Electrical tape bottle cages: In addition to your standard water bottle cage mounts, use about one third to a half roll of electrical tape to add bottle cages to your fork legs or the underside of your down tube. This is a better place to store water than in a backpack. You can also attach tire tubes to your bike using electrical tape.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Classic Bikepacking</h3>
    <p>
      The roots of modern bikepacking are based on using a hardtail cross-country bike or a rigid all-terrain bike (ATB) with soft bags and minimal racks (or none at all). Bikepacking at its core is carrying only the bare necessities on a bike that’s capable, reliable, nimble, and light enough to explore a medley of trails, dirt tracks, and gravel roads.
    </p>
    <h4>Key Gear for This Setup</h4>
    <!-- list element (ul does not have numbers) -->
    <ul>
      <li>Water bottle cages: you should consider putting multiple metal water bottle cages on your fork for easy storage and access to water during your ride.</li>
      <li>Frame bag: this is a quintessential bike bag, and you can see some examples of these below. These bags can take up the entire frame, or only half the frame.</li>
      <li>Handlebar Bag: Even though frame bags may be the most efficient type of bags, handlebar bags can be some of the easiest to use. Some of these can be seen below.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Some Examples of Gear</h2>
    <h3>Full frame bags</h3>
    <p>Full frame bags take up the entirety of your frame triangle and are very easy to use and a great way to maximize storage space on your bike. It is probably best to by a custom frame bag if you want to continue with bikepacking. Here are some of the best custom bag makers.</p>

    <h3>Half frame bags</h3>
    <p>There are smaller frame packs purposefully designed to only use a portion of the frame triangle. This allows it to be paired with one or two water bottles or a cargo cage with other gear.</p>

    <p>handlebar packs go one significant step further by featuring rugged handlebar connections, anti-abrasion patches to reduce damage to and from cables and levers, additional accessory pockets, and elegant solutions for stabilizing the load and accessing gear.</p>
