    <h3> What is Bikepacking?</h3>
    
    <p> 
      Bikepacking is a type of cycling that combines the freedom of mountain 
      biking with the convenience and lightness of backpacking. 
      It is a relatively new and growing trend in cycling, where riders carry all 
      of their gear on their bike and bike over long distances, sometimes even 
      covering hundreds of miles.
